Sample Covariance between B and C (Photograph Preference):
# Data (assuming data is in a matrix named 'prefs')
prefs <- matrix(c(18, 22, 20, 2, 28, 40, 20, 10, 40), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
cov_bc <- cov(prefs[, 2], prefs[, 3])  # Covariance between B and C

print("Sample covariance between B and C:", cov_bc)

Sample Covariance Matrix:
cov_matrix <- cov(prefs)
print("Sample covariance matrix:")
print(cov_matrix)

Sample Correlation between B and C:
cor_bc <- cor(prefs[, 2], prefs[, 3])  # Correlation between B and C

print("Sample correlation between B and C:", cor_bc)

Sample Correlation Matrix:
cor_matrix <- cor(prefs)
print("Sample correlation matrix:")
print(cor_matrix)
