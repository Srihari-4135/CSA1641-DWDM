# Create the boxplot

# Add options to customize the boxplot (optional)
# You can uncomment these lines to add features

# Add horizontal lines for the median and quartiles
# abline(h = boxplot.stats(player_points)$outliers, col = "red", lty = 2)  # Outliers
# abline(h = boxplot.stats(player_points)$box[!is.na(boxplot.stats(player_points)$box)], col = "blue")  # Box quartiles
# abline(h = boxplot.stats(player_points)$med, col = "green", lty = 2)  # Median

# Notches for medians (shows confidence intervals)
